**Translating Arabic to English in Code**

The user wants me to translate all Arabic text within their markdown code block into English without altering any other components – such as code structure. This means adjusting comments and print messages while keeping the code intact. For example, I would translate "توزيع التصنيفات:" to "Distribution of labels:" and "تنفيذ المشروع" to "Project Implementation." Each heading or message in Arabic should be mirrored in English within the code comments, with everything else preserved exactly as it is. I'll provide the translated markdown code next.

Project Implementation  
Phase 1: Understanding and Analyzing Data  
Reading and Understanding the Data

Explanation:  
We load the training and test data using the Pandas library to understand their structure.  
We use `pd.read_csv` to read files like `train_feats.csv` and `test_feats.csv` along with mutation and methylation data.



```python
import pandas as pd

# Load training features data
train_feats = pd.read_csv('train_feats.csv')

# Load test features data
test_feats = pd.read_csv('test_feats.csv')

# Load training mutations data
train_muts = pd.read_csv('train_muts_data.csv')

# Load test mutations data
test_muts = pd.read_csv('test_muts_data.csv')

# Load test methylation data
test_meth = pd.read_csv('test_meth_data.csv')
````

Exploring the Data

Explanation:
We examine the distribution of labels in the training data to check class balance using `value_counts()`.
We check for missing values using `isnull().sum()` to ensure data quality.

```python
# Distribution of labels in the training data
print("Distribution of labels:")
print(train_feats['Label'].value_counts())

# Check for missing values in the training data
print("Missing values in training data:")
print(train_feats.isnull().sum())

# Check for missing values in the test data
print("Missing values in test data:")
print(test_feats.isnull().sum())
```

Mutation Analysis

Explanation:
We extract the sequences surrounding mutations using the `extract_sequences` function from an external file.
We analyze mutation types (e.g., Missense or Nonsense) to understand their impact using `value_counts()`.

```python
from extract_sequences import extract_sequences

# Extract sequences for mutations in the training data
train_sequences = extract_sequences('100_genes.csv', train_muts)

# Analyze distribution of mutation types
print("Distribution of mutation types:")
print(train_muts['mutation_type'].value_counts())
```

Methylation Analysis

Explanation:
We analyze beta values in the methylation data using `describe()` to understand methylation levels.
We link methylation data to genes using `groupby()` to compute the mean for each gene.

```python
# Analyze beta values in methylation data
print("Beta value statistics:")
print(test_meth['beta_value'].describe())

# Link methylation data to genes and compute the mean
gene_meth = test_meth.groupby('gene')['beta_value'].mean()
print("Mean beta value per gene:")
print(gene_meth)
```

Phase 2: Data Processing and Feature Extraction
Processing Mutation Data

Explanation:
We extract mutation type and position from the mutation data to use as features.
We use `extract_sequences` to obtain surrounding sequences for further analysis.

```python
# Extract mutation type and position
train_muts['mutation_type'] = train_muts['mutation_type']
train_muts['position'] = train_muts['position']

# Extract surrounding sequences
train_sequences = extract_sequences('100_genes.csv', train_muts)
```

Processing Methylation Data

Explanation:
We calculate the mean beta values per gene in the methylation data as an additional feature.
We link these features with case identifiers (`case_id`) for later merging.

```python
# Calculate mean beta value per gene
gene_beta_mean = test_meth.groupby('gene')['beta_value'].mean()

# Ensure case identifier is present
test_meth['case_id'] = test_meth['case_id']
```

Feature Extraction

Explanation:
We create new features from mutations, such as the count of each mutation type using `value_counts().unstack()`.
We create methylation features, like the mean beta value per case, using `groupby()`.

```python
# Mutation features: count of each mutation type per case
mutation_counts = train_muts.groupby('case_id')['mutation_type'].value_counts().unstack().fillna(0)

# Methylation features: mean beta value per case
meth_features = test_meth.groupby('case_id')['beta_value'].mean()
```

Merging Features

Explanation:
We merge mutation and methylation features with the training and test feature sets using `merge()`.
We use `case_id` as the merge key, ensuring no data is lost by using `how='left'`.

```python
# Merge mutation features with training data
train_feats = train_feats.merge(mutation_counts, on='case_id', how='left')

# Merge methylation features with test data
test_feats = test_feats.merge(meth_features, on='case_id', how='left')
```

Phase 3: Training the Machine Learning Model
Model Selection

Explanation:
We choose the Random Forest algorithm for its ability to handle complex data.
We use Scikit-learn to implement the model easily and efficiently.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Create the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
```

Data Splitting

Explanation:
We split the training data into training and validation sets using `train_test_split`.
We set aside 20% for validation and fix `random_state` for reproducibility.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Separate features and labels
X = train_feats.drop('Label', axis=1)
y = train_feats['Label']

# Split the data
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Model Training

Explanation:
We train the model on the training set using the combined features.
We use the `fit()` method to apply training to the model.

```python
# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Model Evaluation

Explanation:
We evaluate model performance using accuracy and F1-score on the validation set.
We print the results to assess model effectiveness.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score

# Predict on validation data
y_pred = model.predict(X_val)

# Calculate accuracy and F1-score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_val, y_pred, average='macro')

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'F1-score: {f1}')
```

Hyperparameter Tuning

Explanation:
We use `GridSearchCV` to tune hyperparameters for improved performance.
We define a range of values for `n_estimators` and `max_depth` to test.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define hyperparameters to tune
param_grid = {'n_estimators': [100, 200], 'max_depth': [None, 10, 20]}

# Apply GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Select the best model
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
```

Phase 4: Testing the Model and Analyzing Results
Testing the Model

Explanation:
We use the best-trained model to predict labels on the test data.
We obtain predictions using the `predict()` method.

```python
# Predict on test data
test_predictions = best_model.predict(test_feats)
```

Result Analysis

Explanation:
We analyze predictions if true labels are available (optional).
We print accuracy if possible to evaluate final performance.

```python
# If true labels are available (optional)
# test_accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, test_predictions)
# print(f'Test accuracy: {test_accuracy}')
```

Report Preparation

Explanation:
We write a Markdown report summarizing the methodology and results.
We include accuracy and F1-score as part of the final report.

```markdown
